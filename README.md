Simple [typst math](https://typst.app/docs/reference/math/) to unicode text converter.

# Usage
Simply execute the command `typst_to_text` followed by your typst math.

Exemple :
```shell
$ typst_to_text (u_n) n in NN
(uₙ) n ∈ ℕ
```

As this is my first rust project I'm very open to feedback on what i could improve.
